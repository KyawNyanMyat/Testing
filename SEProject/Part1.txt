1. Judge Biggest Crime
A cybercrime’s "biggest" status is based on the number of victims, financial losses, data sensitivity, disruption, and global consequences. The Equifax breach (2017), Yahoo breach (2013-14), and NotPetya attack (2017) are among the biggest in history based on these criteria.
1. Number of Victims Affected
The more people impacted, the bigger the crime.
Example: Yahoo Data Breach (2013-2014) – 3 billion accounts compromised.
2. Financial Damage ($ Losses)
Includes direct financial theft, legal fines, compensation, and stock losses.
Example: Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme – $64 billion in fraud (biggest financial cybercrime).
3. Data Sensitivity & National Security Impact
If highly sensitive data is stolen (e.g., government, military, financial records), the impact is greater.
Example: Equifax Breach (2017) – 147 million people had Social Security numbers and financial data stolen, putting millions at risk of fraud.
Example: Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Breach (2015) – China stole 21.5 million U.S. government employee records, including fingerprints
4. Economic & Business Disruption
Cyber-attacks that cripple industries or governments are considered major crimes.
Example: NotPetya Ransomware (2017) – Caused $10 billion in damages to global businesses.
5. International & Legal Consequences
If the attack leads to major lawsuits, government action, or international conflict, it’s a significant crime.
Example: PLA’s involvement in the Equifax breach (2017) – Led to U.S. indictments against Chinese military hackers.
