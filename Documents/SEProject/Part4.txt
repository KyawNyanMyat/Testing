Hacker Movements in the Equifax Breach (2017)
The hackers behind the Equifax data breach executed a sophisticated attack using a mix of known vulnerabilities, poor security practices, and lateral movement techniques. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how they infiltrated, moved through the network, and extracted data.

1. Initial Entry – Exploiting Apache Struts Vulnerability
The hackers scanned Equifax’s web applications and discovered that it was running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts.
They used a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit (CVE-2017-5638) to gain control of an internet-facing web server.
Once inside, they installed web shells—malicious scripts that allowed them to execute commands remotely.

2. Gaining Deeper Access – Credential Theft & Lateral Movement
After gaining initial access, the attackers moved deeper into Equifax’s internal network by exploiting poor security controls.
Privilege Escalation:
They searched for stored credentials on the compromised web server.
Found hardcoded usernames and passwords in configuration files.
Used these credentials to access backend databases and other systems.
Lateral Movement:
Equifax failed to segment their network properly, meaning that once inside, the attackers could move freely.
They used Active Directory reconnaissance to map out Equifax’s internal systems.
Exploited additional misconfigured servers to gain access to sensitive data repositories.
