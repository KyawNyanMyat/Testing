6. Response and key mistake that helps hackers
Discovery & Response
Once Equifax detected the breach, they shut down the affected servers and hired cybersecurity firms to investigate.
The breach was publicly disclosed on September 7, 2017—over a month after its discovery.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) later linked the attack to Chinese military hackers (PLA Unit 61398).

Key Mistakes by Equifax That Helped the Hackers
Failure to Patch Known VulnerabilityThe Apache Struts exploit was publicly known two months before the attack, but Equifax did not update their systems.
Lack of Network SegmentationHackers moved freely between web servers, databases, and internal systems.
Weak Access ControlsCredentials were hardcoded in configuration files, making it easy for hackers to escalate privileges.
Poor Monitoring & DetectionThe attackers exfiltrated data for 76 days before Equifax even noticed.
Ineffective Incident ResponseAfter detecting the breach, it still took over a month to notify the public.
U.S. Response & Legal Action
In February 2020, the U.S. indicted the four Chinese hackers, but they were never arrested because they reside in China.
The indictment was mostly symbolic since China does not extradite its citizens.
The case was part of a broader U.S. crackdown on Chinese cyber espionage.
