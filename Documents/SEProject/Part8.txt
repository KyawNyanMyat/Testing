8.Lesson Learn
Lessons Learned
A. Keep Systems Updated – Patch Vulnerabilities Quickly
The Equifax breach happened because the company failed to patch a known vulnerability in Apache Struts.
Lesson: Companies must apply security patches immediately to prevent exploits.
B. Implement Strong Access Controls & Encryption
Hackers stole sensitive data because Equifax did not encrypt Social Security numbers in some databases.
Lesson:
Use strong encryption for personal and financial data.
Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
C. Network Segmentation & Monitoring
Equifax’s poor network segmentation allowed attackers to move laterally and access multiple systems.
The company also failed to detect unusual data transfers for 76 days.
Lesson:
Segment networks so hackers cannot access everything after breaching one system.
Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect suspicious activity.
D. Improve Incident Response & Crisis Management
Equifax took over a month to disclose the breach, leading to delayed consumer protection efforts.
Lesson:
Companies must have a clear incident response plan for cyberattacks.
Transparency and quick disclosure help protect customers and maintain trust.
E. Strengthen Employee Training & Security Culture
Equifax failed to follow basic cybersecurity hygiene, like patching software and monitoring logs.
Lesson:
Train employees on cybersecurity best practices.
Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
