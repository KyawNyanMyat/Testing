3. Data Exfiltration – Stealing & Hiding Data Transfers
Database Access:
The hackers found multiple databases containing sensitive customer information.
Using SQL queries, they extracted names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver’s license numbers.
Data Staging:
Instead of sending the data directly to an external location, they compressed and stored it within the network first.
They likely used custom scripts to automate data collection and avoid detection.
Encrypted Exfiltration:
To avoid triggering security alerts, they encrypted the stolen data before transferring it out.
Used HTTPS traffic and custom obfuscation techniques to bypass monitoring tools.
Sent the data in small chunks over time to prevent raising suspicion.

4. Covering Tracks – Hiding Their Presence
The hackers deleted log files to remove evidence of their activities.
They used anti-forensic techniques like:
Altering timestamps to make their activities blend in with normal traffic.
Obfuscating malware to avoid signature-based detection.
Disabling security alerts on compromised systems.
Equifax’s Security Team Failed to Detect the Breach for 76 Days.
The attackers remained undetected from May to July 2017.
Equifax only discovered the breach on July 29, 2017, when they noticed unusual database activity.
